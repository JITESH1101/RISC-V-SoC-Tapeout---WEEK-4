# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout---WEEK-4

This week, a critical bridge connecting fundamental device physics to practical, real-world circuit analysis is established. The reasoning why SPICE simulation is considered an indispensable tool will be explored, after which the very heart of modern electronics, the NMOS transistor, is investigated. Its core operating principles—from strong inversion and threshold voltage to its resistive and saturation regions—will be examined. The drain current models describing its behavior will be developed and then immediately applied, as the practical syntax for running first SPICE simulations using industry-relevant sky130 models is learned, including the analysis of advanced effects like velocity saturation.

# Conclusion

By the end of this week, a comprehensive journey from single-transistor physics to the full characterization of a fundamental digital gate will have been completed. After the NMOS and PMOS drain current models are mastered, they will be applied to build the cornerstone of digital logic: the CMOS inverter. Its complete Voltage Transfer Curve (VTC) will be derived and analyzed, allowing critical performance metrics like the switching threshold (VM​) and noise margins to be extracted. The final topics, including static vs. dynamic simulation and the analysis of power supply and device variations, will demonstrate precisely why SPICE is the essential tool used to predict, validate, and guarantee that circuit designs will function correctly in the face of real-world imperfections.
